# Tomato_Leaf_Disease_Prediction

Introduction:

Tomato Leaf Disease Prediction is a Deep learning project that aims to detect diseases in tomato leaves using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). This project is designed to assist farmers and gardeners in identifying and addressing diseases in tomato plants early, ultimately improving crop yield and quality.

Tech Stack:

1. Python: The project is primarily developed in Python, making use of its powerful libraries for machine learning and image processing.
2. TensorFlow and Keras: We have used TensorFlow and the high-level API Keras for building and training the CNN model. Keras simplifies the process of building deep learning models.
3. OpenCV: OpenCV is employed for image preprocessing tasks such as resizing, normalization, and augmentation.
4. Matplotlib: Matplotlib is used for visualizing the training and validation results, as well as displaying predictions and images.
5. Jupyter Notebook: Interactive and exploratory coding was done in Jupyter notebooks, allowing for clear documentation of each step in the data analysis and model development process.
6. GitHub: The repository is hosted on GitHub, providing version control and collaboration capabilities.
